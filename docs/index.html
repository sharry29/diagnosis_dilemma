This device is 99% accurate; that is, it will detect the disease in 99% of sick patients and it will give the all-clear in 99% of healthy patients. Medical studies reveal that Probophobia occurs uniformly at random in 1% of the world's population.</p> <p>You go in to the doctor, feeling a little under the weather. She administers the test on you and the device claims that you have the disease. <strong>How likely is it that you actually have Probaphobia?</strong></p> </div> <div class="interElems isEnter" id="guess-response"> <span class="result--high isHidden"> <p>You guessed <strong class="guess-spot"></strong>, but that's actually too high! The correct answer is that you're only 50% likely to have Probaphobia.</p> <p>Don't worry, though: you're in good company with American doctors. When asked this question in 2010, 95 out of 100 doctors gave answers for the the likelihood of a patient having Probaphobia that were way too high!</p> </span> <span class="result--low isHidden"> <p>You guessed <strong class="guess-spot"></strong>, but that's actually too low!
