			<p>Suppose we have a medical device that can test for the presence of an imaginary rare disease called Probaphobia in a patient. This device is 99% accurate; that is, it will detect the disease in 99% of sick patients and it will give the all-clear in 99% of healthy patients. Medical studies reveal that Probophobia occurs uniformly at random in 1% of the world's population.</p>
			<p>You go in to the doctor, feeling a little under the weather. She administers the test on you and the device claims that you have the disease. <strong>How likely is it that you actually have Probaphobia?</strong></p>

				<p>You guessed <strong class='guess-spot'></strong>, but that's actually too high! The correct answer is that you're only 50% likely to have Probaphobia.</p>
				<p>Don't worry, though: you're in good company with American doctors. When asked this question in 2010, 95 out of 100 doctors gave answers for the the likelihood of a patient having Probaphobia that were way too high!</p>

				<p>You guessed <strong class='guess-spot'></strong>, but that's actually too low! The correct answer is that you're actually 50% likely to have Probaphobia.</p>

				<p>Compared to 95 out of 100 American doctors asked this question in 2010, you have a very good read on the situation.</p>
